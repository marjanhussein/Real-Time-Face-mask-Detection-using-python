# Real-Time-Face-mask-Detection-using-python
Technology behind the real-time face mask detection
The goal of the face mask detection system is to create an image recognition system that understands how image classification works
To test the model in real time, I used the VideoCapture function in the OpenCv library. The Cascade classifier is used to detect the frontal face in live video via detectMultiScale
I used a while loop to continue capturing image from webcam
